# SocialNetworkAPI

## Description

A database to hold users, comments, and posts that a typical social network would have. This project was a great way to test out MongoDB and Mongoose as a non-SQL database. 

## Installation 

to get this going, you'll want to install MongoDB for the database. Best to refer to the documentation they have on their site [here:](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

You will also need to install what is in the package.json... To do this, go over to the left side of the file explorer and right click the package.json file. Options should appear, click on the "open in integrated terminal" one. With the terminal open, do an installation by entering the following command: "npm i". This will install all files in the package.json. 

For testing the data and API, you will need to install insomnia to see if the data is going to the correct routes. To install insomnia, refer to the following documentation here: 

## Usage

To begin testing the API, you need to get a server up and running. To do that, run the command "node server.js" to create the server that will listen for the API. With that now done, check out the following video below to test the routes in [insomnia:](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install)
